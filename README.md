# vr-screencheat
Author: Dai-Rong Han
## Introduction
This project is inspired by [Screencheat](https://store.steampowered.com/app/301970/Screencheat/), a
first-person shooter multiplayer game where
all players are invisible, and victory depends
on interpreting each otherâ€™s perspectives.
Built using Unity, this project brings that
concept into VR, emphasizing spatial
perception and head-tracking rather than fast-
paced shooting. To simplify the gameplay for
solo play, the enemy is computer-controlled.

## Software Requirements
This project uses [Unity 2018.4.20f1](https://unity.com/releases/editor/whats-new/2018.4.20#installs) and [Arduino IDE 2.3.6](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software/).
